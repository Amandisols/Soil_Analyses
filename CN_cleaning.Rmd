```{r}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)

```

Import the data.
```{r}
data <- read_excel("data/processed/CN.xlsx", sheet = "Sheet1")

```

The below subsets the data to samples, and adds columns that calculate organic matter (OM) from carbon data as a percent, and a proportion, as well as calculating bulk density from Federer et al. (1993).
```{r}
sub <- subset(data, type == "sample")
added <- cbind(sub, horizon_id = paste0(sub$pedon,"_",sub$horizon), om_pct = sub$C_pct*1.724, om = (sub$C_pct*1.724)/100, bd = (0.111*1.45)/((1.45*(sub$C_pct*1.724)/100)+((1-(sub$C_pct*1.724)/100)*0.111)))

```
